# UCI Adult Dataset EDA

This dataset was compiled by the US Census Bureau in 1994. It is used to group individuals in the US to incomes above or below $50,000. Other variables in the dataset include age, gender, education, race, and hours-per-week worked, and others I feel were not worthy of including in this EDA.
